# PA - Post Apocalyptic

I have recently took quit a dive into the Javascript and Node.js in these incredible courses by [Tony Palicea](http://www.anthonypalicea.com/):

* [Learn and Understand Node](https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/)
* [Javascript: The Weird Parts](https://www.udemy.com/understand-javascript)

Even though these are a few years old, they were FULL of incredible information about how javascript really works.

This game is a friend of mines that I really admire and I want to give them something useful. My goal is to have something that is used and tested so that I can keep updating and fixing bugs.

I plan to use a MEAN stack:
* Express
* Node.js
* Angular 1.x for the frontend
* Mongodb

 I chose to use Angular 1.x because it is lightweight (compared to 2) and I can focus on Node, beings that Ang 1 is much more simple.

 For testing:
 * Jasmine
 * Mocha
 * Selenium

 I have recently heard about Tape, so it is possible I may switch to Tape for testing.
